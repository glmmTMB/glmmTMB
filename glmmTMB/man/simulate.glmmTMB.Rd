\title{Simulate from a glmmTMB fitted model}
\usage{
\method{simulate}{glmmTMB}(object, nsim = 1, seed = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{glmmTMB fitted model}

\item{nsim}{number of response lists to simulate. Defaults to 1.}

\item{seed}{random number seed}

\item{...}{extra arguments}
}
\value{
returns a list of vectors. The list has length \code{nsim}. 
Each simulated vector of observations is the same size as the vector of response variables in the original data set.
}
\description{
Simulate from a glmmTMB fitted model
}
\details{
Simulated values are conditional on estimated random effects. 
Currently, it is not possible to marginalize over these or to simulate for new levels.

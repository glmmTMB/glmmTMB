Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models {(GLMMs)} provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on {GLMMs} in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating {GLMM} parameters in simple cases, complex {GLMMs} are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of {GLMMs} in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize [`]best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

	abstract = {There has been rapid development in tools for multivariate analysis based on fully specified statistical models or 'joint models'. One approach attracting a lot of attention is generalized linear latent variable models (GLLVMs). However, software for fitting these models is typically slow and not practical for large datasets. The R package gllvm offers relatively fast methods to fit GLLVMs via maximum likelihood, along with tools for model checking, visualization and inference. The main advantage of the package over other implementations is speed, for example, being two orders of magnitude faster, and capable of handling thousands of response variables. These advances come from using variational approximations to simplify the likelihood expression to be maximized, automatic differentiation software for model-fitting (via the TMB package) and careful choice of initial values for parameters. Examples are used to illustrate the main features and functionality of the package, such as constrained or unconstrained ordination, including functional traits in 'fourth corner' models, and (if the number of environmental coefficients is not large) make inferences about environmental associations.},

	abstract = {Summary
1. Unconstrained ordination is commonly used in ecology to visualize multivariate data, in particular, to visualize
themain trends between different sites in terms of their species composition or relative abundance.
2. Methods of unconstrained ordination currently used, such as non-metric multidimensional scaling, are algorithm-
based techniques developed and implemented without directly accommodating the statistical properties of
the data at hand. Failure to account for these key data properties can lead to misleading results.
3. A model-based approach to unconstrained ordination can address this issue, and in this study, two types of
models for ordination are proposed based on finite mixture models and latent variable models. Each method is
capable of handling different data types and different forms of species response to latent gradients. Further
strengths of the models are demonstrated via example and simulation.
4. Advantages of model-based approaches to ordination include the following: residual analysis tools for checking
assumptions to ensure the fitted model is appropriate for the data; model selection tools to choose the most
appropriate model for ordination; methods for formal statistical inference to draw conclusions from the ordination;
and improved efficiency, that is model-based ordination better recovers true relationships between sites,
when used appropriately.},

	abstract = {Group-level variance estimates of zero often arise when fitting multilevel or hierarchical linear models, especially when the number of groups is small. For situations where zero variances are implausible a priori, we propose a maximum penalized likelihood approach to avoid such boundary estimates. This approach is equivalent to estimating variance parameters by their posterior mode, given a weakly informative prior distribution. By choosing the penalty from the log-gamma family with shape parameter greater than 1, we ensure that the estimated variance will be positive. We suggest a default log-gamma(2,λ) penalty with λ→0, which ensures that the maximum penalized likelihood estimate is approximately one standard error from zero when the maximum likelihood estimate is zero, thus remaining consistent with the data while being nondegenerate. We also show that the maximum penalized likelihood estimator with this default penalty is a good approximation to the posterior median obtained under a noninformative prior. Our default method provides better estimates of model parameters and standard errors than the maximum likelihood or the restricted maximum likelihood estimators. The log-gamma family can also be used to convey substantive prior information. In either case—pure penalization or prior information—our recommended procedure gives nondegenerate estimates and in the limit coincides with maximum likelihood as the number of groups increases.},

  abstract = {Bayesian data analysis (BDA) is a powerful tool for making inference from ecological data, but its full potential has yet to be realized. Despite a generally positive trajectory in research surrounding model development and assessment, far too little attention has been given to prior specification. Default priors, a sub-class of non-informative prior distributions that are often chosen without critical thought or evaluation, are commonly used in practice. We believe the fear of being too `subjective' has prevented many researchers from using any prior information in their analyses despite the fact that defending prior choice (informative or not) promotes good statistical practice. In this commentary, we provide an overview of how BDA is currently being used in a random sample of articles, discuss implications for inference if current bad practices continue, and highlight sub-fields where knowledge about the system has improved inference and promoted good statistical practices through the careful and justified use of informative priors. We hope to inspire a renewed discussion about the use of Bayesian priors in Ecology with particular attention paid to specification and justification. We also emphasize that all priors are the result of a subjective choice, and should be discussed in that way.},

  abstract = {Bayesian statistical analysis is steadily growing in popularity and use. Choosing priors is an integral part of Bayesian inference. While there exist extensive normative recommendations for prior setting, little is known about how priors are chosen in practice. We conducted a survey (N = 50) and interviews (N = 9) where we used interactive visualizations to elicit prior distributions from researchers experienced withBayesian statistics and asked them for rationales for those priors. We found that participants' experience and philosophy influence how much and what information they are willing to incorporate into their priors, manifesting as different levels of informativeness and skepticism. We also identified three broad strategies participants use to set their priors: centrality matching, interval matching, and visual mass allocation. We discovered that participants' understanding of the notion of 'weakly informative priors"-a commonly-recommended normative approach to prior setting-manifests very differently across participants. Our results have implications both for how to develop prior setting recommendations and how to design tools to elicit priors in Bayesian analysis.},

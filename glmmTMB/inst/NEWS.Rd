    \itemize{
      \item \code{glmmTMB} gains a \code{subset} argument (GH #1128,
      @strengejacke)
      \item added a heterogeneous-variance AR1 (\code{hetar1})
      covariance structure (GH #1095) (experimental, still prints badly)
      \item added the Bell distribution (\code{bell()}) as in
      Castellares et al. 2018 \doi{10.1016/j.apm.2017.12.014} (Hatice

      \item likelihood profiling now works for models with mapped parameters
      \item \code{glmmTMB} no longer changes the order of terms in
      fixed-effect model matrices (GH #1122, @dongwenluo). Note that
      this bug fix will change the order of results (parameter vectors)
      in some cases.
      \item \code{vcov()} behaviour improved for models with mapped
      parameters, especially the case where parameters are set equal rather
      than fixed to starting values (e.g. \code{map = list(beta =
	factor(c(1,1)))}) (GH #1120, @DrJerryTAO)

      zero-inflated models (GH #1101, @strengejacke)

      EXPERIMENTAL; please post any problems at \url{https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB/pull/1068}. See \code{vignette("covstruct")}
      \item added "nbinom12" family after Lindén and Mäntyniemi (2011)

      of a \code{start} argument or in \code{newparams} for
      \code{simulate_new}) may need to be adjusted. (For

\section{CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.9 (2024-03-20)}{
  \subsection{USER-VISIBLE CHANGES}{
    \itemize{
      \item the underlying parameterization of the dispersion for
      Gaussian models has changed from the variance to the standard deviation scale,
      with the following user-visible consequences:
      \itemize{
	\item results of fitting Gaussian models may change slightly,
	especially for unstable fits
	\item stored model objects need to have their \code{betadisp}
	parameters halved for consistency: use \code{up2date(..., adjust_gauss_disp = TRUE)}
	\item parameter estimates for dispersion components will change,
	e.g. from \code{fixef(.)$disp} or \code{confint()} for models
	with dispersion components
	\item any operations that directly handle dispersion parameters
	(e.g. \code{offset} terms for dispersion models) should be
	specified on the SD rather than the variance scale
      }
      \item interpretation of the \emph{weights} variable for
      binomial-type GL(M)Ms has changed. Previously, the \emph{weights}
      argument was \emph{ignored} for a vector- (rather than
      matrix-valued) numeric response, if all observations were either 0 or 1.
      Now the \emph{weights} variable is multiplied by the resonse
      variable to compute the number of successes (consistently with
      \code{stats::glm(., family = "binomial")}). (This change makes
      it easier to use \emph{weights} to specify the number of trials
      per observation for \code{simulate_new()}.)
      \item \code{simulate_new} gives useful warning and error
      messages about unrecognized parameter names and length mismatches
      (length mismatches previously gave only a warning)
    } % itemize
  } % user-visible changes
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item lognormal-hurdle models now work (i.e., zero values
      can occur in the response if \code{ziformula} is specified)
      \item better checking for illegal (negative or non-integer) values
      in response variables
      \item experimental support for priors: see \code{?priors} and
      \code{vignette("priors", package = "glmmTMB")}
    }

      by the mean and standard deviation on the \emph{data scale})
      \item an experimental implementation of penalized splines
      (and related smooth terms) is available, 
      based on \code{mgcv}. See the example using \code{s} in \code{?glmmTMB}.  
      Constructive feedback welcome at
      \url{https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB/issues/928}
      \item population-level prediction with new data no longer requires
      that the variables involved in the random effects be explicitly
      specified as \code{NA} (GH #923, Russ Lenth)
      \item the \code{simulate} method now works for models fitted with
      \code{family=ordbetareg} (GH #942, Daniel Lüdecke)
      \item deviance residuals are now available for some families
      (built-in families from base R (see \code{?family})
      plus \code{nbinom1}, \code{nbinom2}); deviance
      residuals for other families may be implemented on request.
      \item setting \code{option(glmmTMB_openmp_debug=TRUE)} will
      produce debugging output about the number of OpenMP threads used
      \item \code{getME(., "b")} returns the vector of conditional modes
      (BLUPs, in the case of linear mixed models)

  \subsection{USER-VISIBLE CHANGES}{
    \itemize{
      \item changes related to handling rank-deficient fits:
      \itemize{
	\item default value of \code{rank_check} in
	\code{glmmTMBControl} changed to "adjust" (i.e., rank-deficient
	columns of fixed-effect model matrices are automatically dropped, with
	a message, by default)
	\item the \code{include_mapped} argument of \code{vcov} and
	\code{confint} is changed to \code{include_nonest},
	controlling both mapped parameters and those
	dropped due to rank-deficiency, and is now \code{TRUE} by default for
	\code{vcov}
	\item \code{model.matrix} now returns the fixed-effect model matrix
	actually used in fitting (including dropping columns for
	rank-deficiency)

    \itemize{
      \item added a \code{doOptim} argument to \code{fitTMB}, to return
      the constructed TMB object without fitting the parameters
      \item new (experimental) function \code{simulate_new}, to simulate
      from a formula, list of parameters, and covariate data (rather
      than from a fitted object)
      \item \code{emmeans.glmmTMB} method adds two options
      for the \code{component} argument: "response" and "cmean",
      corresponding  to \code{type = "response"} and \code{type = "conditional"} 
      in \code{predict.glmmTMB} (Russ Lenth)
      \item new covariance structure \code{homdiag} (homogeneous diagonal;
      the existing diagonal covariance structure, \code{diag}, assumes heterogeneous
      variances)

\section{CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.5 (2022-11-16)}{
    \subsection{BUG FIXES}{
      \itemize{
	\item improve predict-handling of complex bases (GH #632, #845,
	#853)
	\item all standard deviations are now printed in output for
	models using \code{cs()} (GH #851)
	\item corrected conditional and response predictions for
	truncated distributions (GH #634, #860, #873)

      } % itemize
    } % bug fixes
    \subsection{USER-VISIBLE CHANGES}{
      \itemize{
	\item glmmTMB has switched to using a different (newer, under
	active development) autodifferentiation library under the hood
	(from \code{CppAD} to \code{TMBad}). This is likely to lead to
	small changes in estimates, including tipping marginally stable
	computations to instability or vice versa (e.g. presence or
	absence of convergence warnings, positive-definite Hessian
	warnings, \code{NaN} values of standard errors, etc.) You can revert
	to using the older autodiff engine by commenting out the line
	\code{PKG_CPPFLAGS = -DTMBAD_FRAMEWORK} in \code{src/Makevars}
	and reinstalling the package (make sure to delete .o/.so files
	from the \code{src} directory first if installing from the package
	directory, as the Makefile doesn't recognize know that this
	change requires recompilation).
	\item glmmTMB now warns if fixed-effect model matrices are
	rank deficient (i.e., perfectly collinear predictors); this
	warning can be suppressed by setting
	\code{glmmTMBControl(rank_check="skip")}
	(\code{rank_check = "stop"} will throw an error).
	If \code{rank_check="adjust"}, glmmTMB
	will automatically drop appropriate columns from the model
	matrix  (Daniel B. Stouffer)
	\item the vector of "extra" family parameters
	(Tweedie power, Student-t df,
	etc.) has been renamed from "thetaf" to "psi"; \code{start}
	and \code{map} arguments that set this parameter will need to
	be changed. Users will need to run \code{up2date()}
	when loading stored model objects from previous versions of the
	package.
	\item \code{predict} now warns if extra (ignored) arguments are
	provided in \code{...}

    \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
      \itemize{
	\item Student-t response distribution is now implemented (see
	\code{\link{t_family}})
	\item ordered beta regression as in Kubinec (2022), for
	proportion data containing exact 0 and 1 values, is now
	implemented (\code{\link{ordbeta}})
	\item \code{glmmTMBControl} now has a \code{conv_check} argument
	that allows suppressing convergence warnings
	(the intended use is when these warnings are irrelevant,
	e.g. when running small examples for testing purposes)

      previously supposed to throw an error, but incorrectly returned
      conditional values]
      \item bug fixes and other improvements for \code{diagnose} (inverted Z-score; now handles
      models without random effects)

  diagonal-covariance term (\code{diag(x+y|g)}) rather than being split
  into separate random effects terms as in  \code{lme4}. This should not
  change modeling results, but may change their
  presentation/ordering/etc.. (This is also a bug fix, as double-bar
  notation was not working in several previous versions.)
  \item \code{glmmTMB} now issues a warning when (1) \code{$} is used

      \item \code{vcov(., full=TRUE)} (and hence profiling) now work for models with \code{dispformula=~0}
      \item Documentation fix: when \code{family=genpois}, the
      index of dispersion is known as phi^2.
      \item \code{Anova} now respects the \code{component} argument (GH
      #494, from @eds-slim)
      \item \code{predict} now works when contrasts are set on factors
      in original data (GH #439, from @cvoeten)
      \item \code{bootMer} now works with models with Bernoulli
      responses (even though \code{simulate()} returns a two-column
      matrix in this case) (GH #529, @frousseu)
      \item better support for \code{emmeans} applied to zero-inflation
      or dispersion models (correct link functions) (Russ Lenth)
   }
  } % bug fixes
  \subsection{USER-VISIBLE CHANGES}{
  \itemize{
      \item \code{sigma(.)} now returns \code{NA} for models with
      non-trivial dispersion models (i.e. models with more than one
      dispersion parameter) (raised by GH #533, from @marek-tph)
      \item \code{VarCorr} no longer prints residual variances for
      models with \code{dispformula=~0}
      \item the \code{model.matrix()} and \code{terms()} methods
      for \code{glmmTMB} objects have been slightly modified

\section{CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2.3 (2019-01-11)}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{ranef} now returns information about conditional variances (as
      attributes of the individual random effects terms) by default;
      this information can easily be retrieved by
      \code{as.data.frame(ranef(.))}.
      \item \code{coef} method now available: as in \code{lme4}, returns
      sum of fixed + random effects for each random-effects
      level. (Conditional variances for \code{coef} \emph{not} yet available.)
      \item simulate works for models with genpois family
      \item parametric bootstrapping should work, using
      \code{\link[lme4]{bootMer}} from the \code{lme4} package as a front end.

  } % new features
  \subsection{BUG FIXES}{
    \itemize{
      \item models with multiple types of RE (e.g. ar1 and us)
      may have failed previously (GH #329)
      \item \code{predict} was not handling data-dependent predictors (e.g. \code{poly}, \code{spline}, \code{scale}) correctly
      \item \code{profile} now works for models without random effects
    }
  } % bug fixes
  \subsection{USER-VISIBLE CHANGES}{
    \itemize{
      \item The value returned from \code{simulate} for binomial models
      is now a non-standard data frame where each element contains a
      two-column matrix (as in the base-R \code{\link{simulate}} method for
      binomial GLMS).

} % version 0.2.3
\section{CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2.2 (2018-07-03)}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item REML is now an option (GH #352). It is typically only for
      Gaussian response variables, but can also be useful
      for some non-Gaussian response variables if used with caution
      (i.e. simulate a test case first).
    }
  }
  \subsection{USER-VISIBLE CHANGES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Because family functions are now available for all
      families that have been implemented in the underlying TMB
      code, specifying the \code{family} argument as a raw list (rather than as a family
      function, the name of a family function, or the output of such a
      function) is now deprecated.
    }
  }
}

\section{CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2.1 (2018-05-11)}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item likelihood profiles (via \code{profile}) and likelihood
      profile confidence intervals (via \code{confint(profile(.))})
      can now be computed;
      \code{confint(fitted,method="profile")} and
      \code{confint(fitted,method="uniroot")} (find CIs by using
      a root-finding algorithm on the likelihood profile)
      \item offsets are now allowed in the zero-inflation and dispersion
      formulas as well as in the main (conditional-mean) formula
      (if \code{offset} is specified as a separate argument, it applies
      only to the conditional mean)
      \item zero-truncated generalized Poisson \code{family=truncated_genpois}
      \item zero-truncated Conway-Maxwell-Poisson
      \code{family=truncated_compois}
      \item \code{predict} now allows \code{type} ("link", "response",
      "conditional", "zprob", "zlink")
    }
   }
   \subsection{BUG FIXES}{
     \itemize{
       \item built-in \code{betar()} family for Beta regression fixed
       (and name changed to \code{beta_family()}) (GH #278)
       \item fixed segfault in predict method when response is specified
       as two columns (GH #289)
       \item fixed summary-printing bug when some random effects have
       covariance terms and others don't (GH #291)
       \item fix bugs in binomial residuals and prediction (GH #307)
     }
   }
   \subsection{USER-VISIBLE CHANGES}{
     \itemize{
       \item in \code{predict.glmmTMB},
       the \code{zitype} argument has been rolled into the new
       \code{type} argument: \strong{default prediction type is now
	 "link" instead of "response", in order to match \code{glm()} default}
     }
